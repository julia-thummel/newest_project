        <p>The Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis provides a rigorous education in architecture, art, and design with the outstanding collection of a world-class art museum and the unparalleled resources of a leading research university. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="space col-md-3">
      <a class="btn butn btn-primary" href="programs.html" role="button">FASHION</a>
        <p>The Sam Fox School offers a vast array of programs in art, architecture, and design. In addition to programs for undergraduate and graduate students both on campus in St. Louis and internationally, the School offers summer programs for everyone from high school students to professionals.</p>

        <p>The Sam Fox School is, above all else, a vital, world-changing community of artists, architects, designers, curators, and scholars.

      <p>The BFA in Communication Design is a collaborative program at the intersection of graphic design, illustration, and interaction design. Our faculty have backgrounds in illustration, information design, graphic design, social impact design, interaction design, and advertising. You can choose to design interfaces for mobile devices and the web, make pictures for games and motion graphics, illustrate stories, create comics, and design printed posters and books.
      <p>Some projects allow you to apply design skills to social problems in the community in areas such as public health and urban education. Others provide the chance to study the history of printed images, comics, and advertising through our Modern Graphic History Library.
      <p>In your sophomore year and the fall semester of your junior year, you take courses such as Digital Design, Word and Image, Typography, and Interaction Foundations. By the second semester of your junior year, you choose all of your own major courses.
      <p>As a senior, you pursue a capstone project that culminates in an illustrated book, zine, screen-based presentation, graphic novel/mini-comic, or digital experience. Your final project is displayed in a public exhibition.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-3">
      <img src="IMAGES/fashion.jpg">
        <p>The BFA in Fashion Design provides practical experience designing for mass production, as well as one-of-a-kind pieces. Courses provide a working knowledge of industry standards and procedures, informed by history and current trends.
        <p>During your sophomore year, you build a foundational understanding of fashion research, culture, and design. As you advance in your studies, you undertake projects exploring a spectrum of garment design problems, fabrication strategies, textiles, and illustration, supported by digital tools.
        <p>As a senior, you focus on your own aesthetic through the realization of a signature collection. Often your studies in other areas provide the seeds of inspiration. For instance, Camille Wright, BFA14, incorporated research from a six-week independent study in Senegal, which focused on the globalization of the country's fashion industry and its effects on Senegalese cultural identity. Dance, science-fiction genres, and architecture have similarly influenced other recent collections.</p>

    <div class="col-md-3">
      <img src="IMAGES/art.jpg">
        <p>The College of Art is a high-energy place, where aspiring designers and artists come together. During your time here, you will learn to make things; carefully examine people, communities, and situations; communicate with diverse audiences; and advocate for positive change in the world. Your study will be rigorous and rewarding, challenging and fun. Our classes are taught by leaders in their fields, working on global challenges.
        <p>As you continue your professional journey as an artist, it's critical that you are surrounded with the people, the places, and the resources that represent artistic courage, challenge, exploration, and risk. Our program at the Graduate School of Art is such an arena. We believe that as your inquiry deepens and your vision emerges, your work should become highly individualized and extend beyond traditional boundaries. It's for these reasons that our MFA program is unique.</p>

    <div class="col-md-3">
      <img src="IMAGES/architecture.jpg">
      <p>Our four-year undergraduate degree programs emphasize the development of both making and digital skills, in order to help you become a more creative thinker and designer. All architecture students take similar courses the first three years; however, courses during the fourth year will differ depending on your choice of program.
      <p>The Bachelor of Science in Architecture entails a more intensive study of architecture during your senior year. You'll take a senior-level design studio focused on advanced building design, along with structures courses, architectural history/theory courses that emphasize urban design issues, and technology courses in environmental systems or landscape architecture.
      <p>The Bachelor of Design in Architecture offers greater flexibility. During your senior year, you may choose to take additional architecture design studios, or you may pursue courses in other areas of interest.
      <p>Both programs prepare you to move on to a master's degree, putting you on track for teaching and leadership positions in architecture and other related fields.</p>
