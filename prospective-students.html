        <p>Transfer admission to Washington University is both selective and competitive. In any given year any academic division may have from zero to a small handful of slots available. With this small number of transfer spots open, we recommend the strongest candidates for admission present proof of a high school diploma or equivalent and proof of a high level of academic success at their current institution. Transfer applicants are required to submit transcripts reflecting all collegiate work undertaken. The applicant should submit the Common Application and Washington University's brief supplemental questions at commonapp.org. Your application must be accompanied by a $75 nonrefundable application fee. Transfer students are required to submit a portfolio.</p>
